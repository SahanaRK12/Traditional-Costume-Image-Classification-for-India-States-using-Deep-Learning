# Traditional-Costume-Image-Classification-for-India-States-using-Deep-Learning
The project, Traditional Costume Image Classification for Indian States Using DL aims to utilize advanced DL techniques to categorize and identify diverse cultural traditions reflected in images. This effort seeks to highlight rich variety of traditions across India by using cutting-edge classification models. Main objective is to develop system accurately identify and categorize unique traditional practices, attire, rituals and artifacts of each state. The visual diversity present in cultural practices across different regions, image classification becomes an effective way to document and showcase these vibrant traditions. The project starts by gathering a comprehensive dataset of diverse images representing traditions from various Indian states. It utilizes DL techniques, particularly CNN or similar architectures, autonomously learn and identify features and patterns from these images. This enables system to effectively distinguish subtle differences in traditional practices. The project's significance lies in contribution to cultural preservation, awareness and education.
